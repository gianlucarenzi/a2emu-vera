; boot.s -- Disk II boot sector (track 0, sector 0): loads NSECT sectors to LOAD
; and jumps there.  No DOS: it reuses the P5A PROM's sector reader at $Cn5C,
; which re-enters us at $0801 after every sector ($27 and $3D already advanced).
; The payload follows on the disk in physical-sector order: track 0 sectors
; 1-15, then track 1 sectors 0-15, and so on.
;
; Build: cl65 -t none --start-addr 0x800 --asm-define NSECT=n --asm-define LOAD=0x900
